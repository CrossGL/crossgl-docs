## How Dyson Charges You

Dyson operates on a **credit-based billing system**. This means you purchase and use credits to pay for optimization services as you go. [See price here : ].

### Add Your Payment Method:

1. Once youâ€™ve signed up, head to the Billing page.
2. Click **Go to Portal** and follow the prompts to add your payment method.

### Receive Free Credits:

- Upon adding your payment method, youâ€™ll receive **$15 in free credits** to get started! ðŸŽ‰

### Usage-Based Charges:

- Dyson charges credits for each request, which can vary depending on the size, complexity, and type of hardware being used (e.g., CPU, GPU, TPU, or FPGA).
- The system tracks the number of credits required in real-time and deducts them from your balance accordingly.

### View and Manage Credits:

- You can view your available balance, top-up credits, and set up automatic refills to avoid disruptions.

### Transparent Invoicing:

- Full usage reports and invoices are available to download from the Billing page, so youâ€™ll always have a clear picture of where your credits are going.

## What Youâ€™re Charged For

When using Dyson, youâ€™ll be charged credits for the following services:

1. **Optimization Requests**: Every time Dyson routes your code to the most efficient hardware, credits are deducted based on the computational load and the hardware type used.
2. **Hardware Usage**: The cost of running tasks on specific hardware (e.g., GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs) will vary, as some hardware has higher associated costs.
3. **Telemetry and Monitoring**: Access to real-time telemetry and performance reports are included, but certain enterprise features may incur additional charges.

Our system ensures youâ€™re only paying for the value Dyson provides, and youâ€™ll never be charged beyond your credit balance.
